## Pebbling Game
The Pebbling Game is a web-based game that challenges players to strategically place pebbles on nodes in a graph while adhering to specific rules. The game is designed to help players understand graph theory concepts and improve their problem-solving skills.

## Overview
The game board consists of a directed graph with nodes and edges. Each node can either be empty or contain a pebble. The objective of the game is to place pebbles on the nodes while following the rules outlined below.

## Rules
A pebble can only be placed on a node if all of its child nodes (i.e., the nodes connected to it by edges) also have pebbles.  
A pebble can be removed from a node at any time.  
Players can click on a node to place or remove a pebble. If a player attempts to place a pebble on a node that does not meet the rules, the game will provide a visual hint by briefly highlighting the child nodes that need pebbles.

## Legend
Empty Node: A node without a pebble, represented by a light gray circle.  
Pebble: A node containing a pebble, represented by a black circle.  
## Statistics
Pebbles Used: The number of pebbles currently placed on the game board.  
Max Pebbles: The maximum number of pebbles placed on the game board at any given time.  
## Implementation
The Pebbling Game is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game board is rendered using the HTML canvas element, and the game logic is handled by JavaScript. The layout and styling of the page are done using CSS.  

## Getting Started
To play the game, simply open the provided HTML file in a modern web browser. The game will automatically load, and you can begin playing by clicking on the nodes to place and remove pebbles.

Have fun playing and improving your graph theory skills!
